eXist-db MongoDB driver
========================================

This eXist-db extention provides xquery functions to access functions of an MongoDB database.

In addition to "regular" [MongoDB](https://github.com/dizzzz/eXistdb-MongoDB-extension/wiki/MongoDB) operations the extension also provides [GridFS](https://github.com/dizzzz/eXistdb-MongoDB-extension/wiki/GridFS) based functions to manage arbitrary sized documents stored in MongoDB.

Documentation can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/dizzzz/eXistdb-MongoDB-extension/wiki)
